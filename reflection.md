- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I found this assignment easier than both Assignment 2 and Assignment 3, because the instructions were so specific and the CarRequirements, EngineRequirements, PassengerRequirements, and TrainRequirements files all were very helpful. Step 3 and Step 4 of the homework instructions really showed me how I could incorporate Encapsulation into my own programming. Like all other homework assignments, I frequently found myself double-checking StackOverflow and GeeksForGeeks on what exactly I should do for my attributes and methods, and semicolons and open brackets were a bit tedious to figure out, but I felt like I was in a good place with this assignment.
